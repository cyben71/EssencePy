**EssencePy** is a lightweight and modular Python project designed to serve as a modular foundation for technical projects and automation workflows.
It brings together reusable utilities, structured code organization, and cross-platform compatibility (Linux & Windows), making it ideal for building reliable tools quickly.

> EssencePy is the *core essence* of many future tools — minimal yet extensible.

## 🚀 Key Features

- 🔧 **Modular Design** — Clean separation of concerns, designed for easy customization and extension.
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** — Compatible with both Linux and Windows environments.
- 🗂️ **Structured Setup** — Includes standard directories for logs, scripts, notebooks, configs, and reusable libraries.
- 📦 **Utilities Included** — Config reader, environment info loader, and more.
- 🧪 **Notebook/Script Ready** — Load and execute code from Jupyter or as standalone Python scripts.

## 📌 Goals

- Provide a reusable starting point for scripting, automation or other cool stuff
- Maintain simplicity while allowing for scalability
- Ensure portability and easy setup across environments

## 📣 About

This project started as a personal toolkit to accelerate scripting and automation tasks across various technical contexts.
Now open-sourced to share its benefits, and evolve through real-world usage.

Feel free to fork, extend, and adapt EssencePy to your own workflows 💡

## 🛠️ How to use EssencePy
1. First of all, clone the project 😉
2. Edit `conf/env.conf` file and **setup** location for Python binaries in **PARENT_PYTHON_HOME** (for Linux) or **WIN_PARENT_PYTHON_HOME** (for Windows)
3. Fulfill `conf/requirements.txt` file to add your required Python libs to project
4. Launch the required script `project-init` (with correct extension for your system)

This setup and script will create a **Python virtual environment**, loads dependencies and enables Jupyter (which can be used in your IDE, converting notebook...etc ). 

### Main functions
```shell
# Converting a Jupyter notebook (example with a Windows OS)
# Notebook is called myNotebook.ipynb and stored in "notebooks" folder 
cd <APPLICATION_HOME>/scripts/powershell
.\notebook-converter.ps1 myNotebook.ipynb
```
```shell
# Launching my Python program (example with a Windows OS)
# Program is called myNotebook.py and stored in "app" folder 
cd <APPLICATION_HOME>/scripts/powershell>
.\app-start.ps1 myNotebook.py
```
## 💡 Some use cases
```md
> Tip: I want to use my own Python lib. 
Put your Python lib in "lib/" folder, then :
```
```python
# import your class
from lib.my_class import MyClass

# instanciate
my_cls = MyClass(**kargs)

# using
foo = my_cls.function()
```



```md
> Tip: I already have a Python program.

Put your Python program in "app" folder and launch it with the required script
```

```md
> Tip: VScode do not allow me to use my virtual env.

VScode could be a little bit ennoying and can not detect your fresh Python virtual env. 
You have to set "python.defaultInterpreterPath" with your Python virtual env in VScode settings
By default with value like: "rt/python/bin/python3"
```
### Currently working with
- Windows 10    | Powershell 5.1    | Python 3.12.8
- Centos 7      | Bash 4.2.46       | Python 3.11.11
- MacOS 15      | Zsh 5.9           | Python 3.12 (installed by brew)
